Ethical Hacking Assignment - Group 24
This repository contains the documentation, evidence, and analysis of a comprehensive penetration test conducted on a simulated network environment for the PUSL 3132: Ethical Hacking coursework at Plymouth University.

📚 Objectives
- 🔎 Assess the security posture of the Clarke’s Ceylon Team digital infrastructure.

🕵️‍♂️ Identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker.

💻 Demonstrate successful exploitation and post-exploitation activities.

🛡️ Provide actionable mitigation recommendations to improve security.

📝 Methodology
🗂️ Planning: Defined scope, constraints, and methodologies.

🌐 Reconnaissance: Collected information using Nmap and Nessus.

🛡️ Threat Modeling: Identified critical assets and potential threats.

🔎 Vulnerability Assessment: Employed automated tools and manual analysis.

💥 Exploitation: Conducted targeted attacks using Metasploit.

🗃️ Post-Exploitation: Collected sensitive data and performed lateral movement.

🖋️ Reporting: Documented findings, screenshots, and mitigation strategies.

🛠️ Key Tools Used
🔍 Nmap: Network scanning and service discovery.

🔒 Nessus: Vulnerability assessment.

🎯 Metasploit: Exploitation and post-exploitation framework.

🔑 John the Ripper: Password hash cracking.

🚨 Findings
⚠️ SMBv1/SMB Signing Disabled: Enabled exploits like EternalBlue (MS17-010).

🔑 Weak/Default Credentials: Allowed unauthorized access.

🖥️ Outdated Operating Systems and Software: Created exposure to known exploits.

📡 Insecure Protocols: Use of Telnet and self-signed SSL certificates.

⚙️ Misconfigured Services: FTP with anonymous access, misconfigured SSH.

🔥 Key Exploitation Highlights
🎯 Successful exploitation of MS17-010 (EternalBlue) on host 172.168.0.38, resulting in a Meterpreter session and password hash extraction.

🔑 Cracking of password hashes using John the Ripper.

🛡️ Mitigation Recommendations
⬆️ Update and patch outdated software and operating systems.

🔒 Enforce SMB signing and disable SMBv1.

🚫 Replace Telnet with SSH and enforce strong encryption protocols (TLS 1.2+).

🧩 Use multi-factor authentication and strong password policies.

🛠️ Regularly review firewall configurations and disable unused services.
