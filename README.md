Ethical Hacking Assignment - Group 24
This repository contains the documentation, evidence, and analysis of a comprehensive penetration test conducted on a simulated network environment for the PUSL 3132: Ethical Hacking coursework at Plymouth University.

📚 Objectives
Assess the security posture of the Clarke’s Ceylon Team digital infrastructure.

Identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker.

Demonstrate successful exploitation and post-exploitation activities.

Provide actionable mitigation recommendations to improve security.

📝 Methodology
Planning: Defined scope, constraints, and methodologies.

Reconnaissance: Collected information using Nmap and Nessus.

Threat Modeling: Identified critical assets and potential threats.

Vulnerability Assessment: Employed automated tools and manual analysis.

Exploitation: Conducted targeted attacks using Metasploit.

Post-Exploitation: Collected sensitive data and performed lateral movement.

Reporting: Documented findings, screenshots, and mitigation strategies.

🛠️ Key Tools Used
Nmap: Network scanning and service discovery.

Nessus: Vulnerability assessment.

Metasploit: Exploitation and post-exploitation framework.

John the Ripper: Password hash cracking.

🚨 Findings
SMBv1/SMB Signing Disabled: Enabled exploits like EternalBlue (MS17-010).

Weak/Default Credentials: Allowed unauthorized access.

Outdated Operating Systems and Software: Created exposure to known exploits.

Insecure Protocols: Use of Telnet and self-signed SSL certificates.

Misconfigured Services: FTP with anonymous access, misconfigured SSH.

🔥 Key Exploitation Highlights
Successful exploitation of MS17-010 (EternalBlue) on host 172.168.0.38, resulting in a Meterpreter session and password hash extraction.

Cracking of password hashes using John the Ripper.

🛡️ Mitigation Recommendations
Update and patch outdated software and operating systems.

Enforce SMB signing and disable SMBv1.

Replace Telnet with SSH and enforce strong encryption protocols (TLS 1.2+).

Use multi-factor authentication and strong password policies.

Regularly review firewall configurations and disable unused services.
